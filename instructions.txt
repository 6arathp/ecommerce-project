Perfect — since you’re using a **local LLM CLI tool** to generate the full **E-Commerce MERN app**, here’s a **human-sounding, well-structured prompt** you can paste directly into your tool.
It’s written like you’re giving a complete developer brief to an AI code assistant 👇

---

### 🧠 Prompt for Local LLM CLI

```
You are a full-stack web developer.  
I want you to generate a complete E-Commerce web app based on the following details.  
The app should be production-ready, structured, and easy to run locally.

---

### 🏗️ Project Goal
Build an **E-Commerce Website** that lets users:
- Explore products
- View detailed product pages
- Add and remove products from a shopping cart

It should have a **clean, responsive UI**, **lightweight backend**, and **basic cart state management**.

---

### 💻 Tech Stack
**Frontend:** React.js with React Router  
**Backend:** Node.js with Express.js  
**Database:** MongoDB Atlas (connection URL already in `.env` as `MONGO_URI`)

---

### ⚙️ Project Structure
Use a typical MERN stack folder layout:
```

/client     → React frontend
/server     → Node.js + Express backend

````

Each should have its own `package.json` and run separately.  
The frontend should be served via `npm start`, and the backend via `npm run dev`.

---

### 🧩 Functional Requirements
#### Frontend (React)
- Home page that lists all products fetched from backend API (`/api/products`)
- Product detail page (`/product/:id`)
- Shopping cart page (`/cart`)
- Navbar that displays cart count and links
- Use React Router for navigation
- Use Context API (or Redux Toolkit) for managing cart state
- Responsive UI using simple CSS or TailwindCSS

#### Backend (Express)
- Connect to MongoDB Atlas using `mongoose`
- Define REST API routes:
  - `GET /api/products` – get all products
  - `GET /api/products/:id` – get product details
  - `POST /api/cart` – add item to cart
  - `GET /api/cart` – get all cart items
  - `DELETE /api/cart/:id` – remove item from cart
- Use Express middlewares: `cors`, `express.json`, and `dotenv`
- Store product data in MongoDB (use seed data if needed)

---

### 🧾 Database Schema (Mongoose)
**Product Model**
```js
{
  name: String,
  price: Number,
  category: String,
  description: String,
  image: String
}
````

**Cart Model**

```js
{
  productId: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
  quantity: Number
}
```

---

### 🔄 API Flow

1. Frontend fetches products from `/api/products`
2. When user clicks “Add to Cart”, send a POST to `/api/cart`
3. Cart page fetches `/api/cart` to show current items
4. User can delete from cart using `DELETE /api/cart/:id`

---

### 🧰 Environment

Use a `.env` file containing:

```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```

---

### 🚀 Output Requirements

* Generate clean and well-commented source code
* Include minimal README with steps to run both client and server
* Use `npm install` for dependencies
* Automatically handle CORS and error responses
* Keep UI minimal but professional

---

### ✅ Deliverables

1. Complete folder structure (`/client`, `/server`)
2. Ready-to-run code
3. README with setup instructions

---

Now generate the **complete project** based on these details.
If possible, output the file structure first to a txt file, then progressively fill in the code files for each section.
and also write proper documentation to a README file that i can use on github.
